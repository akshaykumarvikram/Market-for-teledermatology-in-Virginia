  <h1>Opportunities for Tele-dermatology in Virginia.</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, more people have been diagnosed with skin cancer than all other cancers combined and the Skin Cancer Foundation says there's approximately 87,000 new melanoma cases diagnosed annually. So if you have melanoma, it would be ideal to catch it early to stop any spreading. Getting immediate healthcare treatment will be your best chance at surviving such a frightening ordeal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, getting immediate detection and treatment is not readily available for everyone. Millions of Americans actually have to wait for months for their scheduled appointment with a dermatologist because of an alarming shortage of dermatologists in the country. There are actually an insufficient number of doctors in general, but the field of dermatology is already at its critical stage.</p>
<p>The country has around 55,000 practicing pediatricians, 40,000 gynecologists, 38,000 psychiatrists, and only 10,845 dermatologists. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) though, the US needs at least 22,000 dermatologists to give necessary healthcare treatments in an appropriate amount of time to all of those who have skin issues.</p>
<p>As reported by a study published in the journal JAMA Dermatology, among areas of the country with at least one dermatologist, 75% have less than four for every 100,000 people, which is the required number to give adequate care for everyone in one area. The study however, didn&rsquo;t investigate places with zero dermatologists. Women&rsquo;s Health magazine has discovered a more disturbing statistic. One out of every five areas in the US has no dermatologists at all.</p>
<p>For those who live in big cities, there&rsquo;s most likely a dermatologist near you. Plenty of women in rural areas and medium-sized towns are unfortunately living in what are known as called &ldquo;derm-desserts.&rdquo; These are areas that have zero dermatologists within 50 or even 100 miles. And the areas with fewer dermatologists have more melanoma deaths. That&rsquo;s a double blow for women because since the 70s, melanoma rates among women aged 18 -39 have soared by an unbelievable 800 percent.</p>
<p>That's why many dermatology offices are looking into ways to meet the demand, including telemedicine and increasing the use of nurses and physician assistants.</p>
<p><strong>Dermatology in Virginia</strong></p>
<p>There is an immense potential for dermatology in Mid-south region of Virginia. State of Virginia seems to be following the rest of the country, with most dermatologist being located near big cities creating large &ldquo;derm-desserts&rdquo;. &nbsp;In counties such as Lunenburg, patients have to travel on an average 43.59 miles to find a dermatologist.</p>
<p>I have created the following dashboard to identify potential markets for tele-dermatology in Virginia. In the dashboard we have identified the nearest dermatologist and the average distance to a dermatologist from each zip code to identify &ldquo;derm desserts&rdquo;.</p>
